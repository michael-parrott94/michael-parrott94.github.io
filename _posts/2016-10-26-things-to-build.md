title: Things to Build

<p>I have been thinking about different projects that I can build. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Grocery tracker</strong>:
    <p>I'm curious about how much I spend on groceries from week to week,
    and if the prices of food are going up. I want to make something that keeps track of how
    much I spend and on what, and be able to track the prices of specific items from week to week.</p>
    
    <p>When I initially think about it, it's easy to just use a database or excel, but I'm not
    sure if that would be limiting at all in terms of what I could with it in the future.</p>
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li><strong>Inventory tracker</strong>:
    <p>I'm not sure "inventory tracker" is the right term for this.
    But the idea is that in lots of places, there are things that break, and it might be difficult
    for someone to learn about this.</p>
    
    <p>For example, in a university classroom, chairs might break,
    or tables might begin to wobble. If there was a cheap, small device that could be placed
    in these areas that notified someone of problems, that could help raise awareness of broken
    things.</p>
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li><strong>Mental math</strong>:
    <p>Make a program that would help improve my mental math skils. This would be
    something like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing smaller numbers (maybe moderately
    sized numbers as well).</p>
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li><strong>Some sort of library</strong>: ???</li>
</ul>
