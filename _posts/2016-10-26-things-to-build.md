title: Things to Build
layout: post

<p>I have been thinking about different projects that I can build. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grocery tracker: I'm always curious about how much I spend on groceries from week to week,
  and if the prices of food are going up. I want to make something that keeps track of how
  much I spend and on what, and be able to track the prices of specific items from week to week.
  When I initially think about it, it's pretty easy to just use a database or excel, but I'm not
  sure if that would be limiting at all in terms of what I could with it in the future.</li>

  <li>Inventory tracker: I'm not sure inventory tracker is really the right term for this.
  But the idea is that in lots of places, there are things that break, and it might be difficult
  for someone to learn about this. For example, in a university classroom, chairs might break,
  or tables might begin to wobble. If there was a cheap, small device that could be placed
  in these areas that notified someone of problems, that could help raise awareness of broken
  things.</li>

  <li>Mental math: make a simple program that would help improve my mental math skils. This would be
  something simple like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing smaller numbers (maybe moderately
  sized numbers as well).</li>

  <li>Some sort of library: ???</li>
</ul>
