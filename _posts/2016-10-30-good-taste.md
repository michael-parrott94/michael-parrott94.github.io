title: The "Good Taste" Coding Requirement

<p>Recently, I read an article about Linus Torvalds "Good Taste" Coding Requirement:

</a>
</p>

  This article struck a chord with me because I have found myself in situations where I've seen code or
  written code that has been in "bad taste." One question that comes to my mind after reading this is how
  does someone develop good taste? In my cases, I haven't been able to pinpoint exactly why something was off.
  In the article, it mentions that <q>The fewer conditions you test for, the better your code <em>tastes</em>.</q>
  Are there other criteria like this that help you figure this out?
</p>

<p>
  With experience, I'm hoping that I'll be able to put what I think is "good taste" into concrete terms.
  One way of helping developing this is always thinking how you can make your code better. If you try out
  different variations of code to accomplish the same thing, there will be some variations that do things
  better or worse. By trying to evaluate these different pieces of code for things like readability and
  future maintainability, the ability to write better code in the future should improve.
