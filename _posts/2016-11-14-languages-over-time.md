title: History of my Favourite Language
layout: post
---

<p>Over the course of my programming life, I've used a variety of different languages for
a variety of different things. At different points, I've had different "go to" or favourite
languages. Here is what they have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>
    <strong>Python</strong>:
    Python has been my favourite and most used language for a few years. It's simple, which
    makes it easy to go back to after not using it for a while. It makes coding in it much
    more enjoyable, since there is not as much syntax to remember. There are a lot of great
    libraries for it, such as the Python requests library. One thing that is unfortunate
    is the division between Python 2 and Python 3. Over time this is becoming less of an issue,
    but I'm still not up to date on new things in Python 3. Python is my main language to
    use for programming competitions and interviews because of the ease of writing code in it.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <strong>C++</strong>:
    I've used C++ at a few different points in my life. It was one of the first languages I learned, and
    I tried using it for some desktop games. I never created anything too serious, but made simple
    demos with the <a href="http://liballeg.org/">Allegro</a> library, as well as using it for
    a few university projects. For one internship, I used C++ primarily and learned many of the
    new features in C++11.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <strong>Java</strong>:
    I began using this in high school, and ever since would knew it fairly well, using it for
    some coding competitions and some interviews. It was (and probably still is) my main C-style
    language that I use for coding if necessary.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <strong>Scala</strong>:
    I'm not sure I would have ever said this is my strongest language over Python, but I
    would say that it was my favourite. I used this for 4 months for an internship, and
    thought that the language was fun to use and had a lot of cool, useful features. After
    that internship I never had the chance to use it again, so I wouldn't really say I'm
    familiar with the language anymore. If I got the opportunity to use it again I definitely
    would, and have a feeling that if I were to start using it again, it would become my
    favourite language.
  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other languages that I've used and actually made things with would be <strong>Turing</strong>
(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">here</a>)
It's a language primarily used in Canadian high school for teaching purposes, and makes it
very easy to do things like drawing graphics and images on the screen. It was fun to use,
but wouldn't make anything too serious with it.</p>

<p>In high school, I had the pleasure of using Visual Basic 6. It seems to have a bad reputation,
but as a teaching language, I found it to be great. Like Turing, it made graphics very easy, and
for my final project, I created <a href="/projects/geometrywars">Geometry Wars</a>, something
that I was very proud of.</p>
