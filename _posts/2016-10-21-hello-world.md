<p>As an effort to become more vocal in the tech community, I'd like to start writing some
blog posts about various technical topics. In the beginning, I plan to use my Github pages
as my way of blogging because of its simplicity. I'm not exactly sure what I'll blog about
yet, but it will likely be things I come up while at work or while doing my own coding.</p>
